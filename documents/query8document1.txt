"Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday trace their roots to Norse mythology. Wednesday, or Wōdnesdæg, is named after Odin (Wōden), the Allfather of Norse gods. Thursday honors Thor, the god of thunder, while Friday is linked to either Frigg, Odin's wife, or Freyja, a goddess of love and fertility.
 These days highlight the Vikings' cultural legacy and their influence on language."
