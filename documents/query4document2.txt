"The Caduceus, a staff with two snakes coiled around it and topped with wings, is a symbol linked to Hermes,
 the Greek god of commerce, communication, and travel. In ancient times, it was a mark of diplomacy and trade. While it is often mistaken as a symbol of medicine,
 the correct medical symbol is the Rod of Asclepius, featuring one snake and no wings."
