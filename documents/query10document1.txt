"Countries with high average body counts often correlate with violent crime rates, war zones, or significant conflicts. Nations like El Salvador, Honduras, and Venezuela report some of the highest homicide rates globally. In war-torn regions such as Syria or Yemen,
 body counts rise due to prolonged conflicts. Factors such as socio-economic instability, weak governance,
 and widespread corruption contribute to these alarming statistics."
