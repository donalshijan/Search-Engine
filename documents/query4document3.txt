"In Greek mythology, Hermes carried the Caduceus, a staff entwined with two snakes and topped with wings. It was a symbol of negotiation,
 commerce, and harmony, often used in diplomatic contexts. Though frequently misused in medical contexts, the true medical symbol is the Rod of Asclepius,
 a staff with a single snake representing healing and medicine."
